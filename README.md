# Clustering Case Study: Customer Segmentation with K-Means -  Tier 3
***
This case study is based on [this blog post](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/customer-segmentation-using-python.html) by the `yhat` blog. Please feel free to refer to the post for additional information, and solutions.

Structure of the mini-project:

1. **Sourcing and loading**
    * Load the data
    * Explore the data


2. **Cleaning, transforming and visualizing**
    * Data Wrangling: Exercise Set 1
        - Creating a matrix with a binary indicator for whether they responded to a given offer
        - Ensure that in doing so, NAN values are dealt with appropriately
    

3. **Modelling** 
    * K-Means clustering: Exercise Sets 2 and 3
        - Choosing K: The Elbow method
        - Choosing K: The Silhouette method
        - Choosing K: The Gap statistic method
    
    * Visualizing clusters with PCA: Exercise Sets 4 and 5


4. **Conclusions and next steps**
    * Conclusions
    * Other clustering algorithms (Exercise Set 6)
